## 单链表存储结构
```c++
typedef struct LNode{
    ElemType data;
    struct LNode *next;
}LNode,*Linklist;
```

## 头插法创建单链表
```c++
LinkList CreateLinklist(){
    LinkList L,s;
    ElemType n;
    L = (LinkList)malloc(sizeof(LNode));//带头结点的单链表
    L -> next = NULL;
    while(cin >> n){
        s = (LinkList)malloc(sizeof(LNode));
        s -> data = n;
        s -> next = L -> next;
        L -> next = s;
    }
    return L;
}
```
* 头插法每次将新节点插入到头结点之后，因此创建的单链表是逆序的

## 尾插法创建单链表
```c++
LinkList CreateLinklist(){
    LinkList L = NULL,s,rear;
    ElemType n;
    while(cin >>　n){
        if(L == NULL){
            L = (LinkList)malloc(sizeof(LNode));//不带头结点的单链表
            L -> data = n;
            L -> next = NULL;
            rear = L;
            continue;
        }
        s = (LinkList)malloc(sizeof(LNode));
        s -> data = n;
        s -> next = NULL;
        rear -> next = s;
        rear = s;
    }
    return L;
}
```
* 尾插法通过`rear`指针标记链表结尾，因此链表是顺序的

**<h3 style="color:#7ca9ed">Problem Description</h3>**  

    After the 1997/1998 Southwestern European Regional Contest (which was held in Ulm) a large contest party took place. The organization team invented a special mode of choosing those participants that were to assist with washing the dirty dishes. The contestants would line up in a queue, one behind the other. Each contestant got a number starting with 2 for the first one, 3 for the second one, 4 for the third one, and so on, consecutively. 
    The first contestant in the queue was asked for his number (which was 2). He was freed from the washing up and could party on, but every second contestant behind him had to go to the kitchen (those with numbers 4, 6, 8, etc). Then the next contestant in the remaining queue had to tell his number. He answered 3 and was freed from assisting, but every third contestant behind him was to help (those with numbers 9, 15, 21, etc). The next in the remaining queue had number 5 and was free, but every fifth contestant behind him was selected (those with numbers 19, 35, 49, etc). The next had number 7 and was free, but every seventh behind him had to assist, and so on. 
    Let us call the number of a contestant who does not need to assist with washing up a lucky number. Continuing the selection scheme, the lucky numbers are the ordered sequence 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, etc. Find out the lucky numbers to be prepared for the next contest party. 

**<h3 style="color:#7ca9ed">Input</h3>**  

    The input contains several test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n. You may assume that 1 <= n <= 3000. A zero follows the input for the last test case. 

**<h3 style="color:#7ca9ed">Output</h3>** 

    For each test case specified by n output on a single line the n-th lucky number.

**<h3 style="color:#7ca9ed">Problem Description</h3>**  

    圆桌上围坐着2n个人。其中n个人是好人，另外n个人是坏人。如果从第一个人开始数数，数到第m个人，则立即处死该人；然后从被处死的人之后开始数数，再将数到的第m个人处死……依此方法不断处死围坐在圆桌上的人。试问预先应如何安排这些好人与坏人的座位，能使得在处死n个人之后，圆桌上围坐的剩余的n个人全是好人。 

**<h3 style="color:#7ca9ed">Input</h3>**  

    多组数据，每组数据输入：好人和坏人的人数n（<=32767）、步长m（<=32767）； 

**<h3 style="color:#7ca9ed">Output</h3>** 

    对于每一组数据，输出2n个大写字母，‘G’表示好人，‘B’表示坏人，50个字母为一行，不允许出现空白字符。相邻数据间留有一空行。
